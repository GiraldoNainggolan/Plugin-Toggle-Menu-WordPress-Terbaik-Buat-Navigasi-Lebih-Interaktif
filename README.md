# Content Ideas for WordPress Toggle Menu

A toggle menu can attract users' interest in reading the provided content strategically by displaying it when clicked. Designing the toggle menu with web icons or a different background color will create an effective and interactive menu. Using a toggle menu on a webpage helps enhance focus on key information before transitioning to details. This is mainly possible because each toggle menu is usually presented with a specific UI design and a prominent title text header to distinguish it from the expanded content.

Here are some techniques for adding a toggle menu to a WordPress site. Note that this article focuses solely on using WordPress plugins rather than manual code snippets for easier installation and customization.

### 1. WordPress Page Builder Plugins & Supported Add-ons

Many popular WordPress Page Builder plugins include a toggle menu feature that can be configured from the pluginâ€™s editor. However, customization settings are usually limited to one preset style or without an option to add media content in the collapsible section.

The Elementor page builder plugin has a Toggle widget to hide or display content, such as FAQs. If you want to explore other toggle menu designs, you can install add-ons for Elementor, such as **Essential Addons for Elementor, Happy Addons, and ElementsKit.**
